		<h3>Week 1 (April 3rd Class)</h3>
		<p>
			Today I learned the basics of HTML and CSS.  I orginally thought that CSS stood for something close to Computer Science Something, but turns out I was completely wrong.  Class is actually pretty fun considering its 3 hours long.  Definitely easier to handle than 3 hours of my IEMS 383 class: Service Operations Management.

		<h3>Week 2 (April 10th Class)</h3>
		<p>
			Learned some more cool elements I'm going to try and implement in this website.  Also learned about the semantics associated with web designing.  Who knew there was a "semantic" difference between "<b>" which I originally thought stood for bold and actually bolding.  Found out the the "<b>" actually meant "stylistically offset."  Feels like I'm back in grammer or poetry again.  Technicalities..
